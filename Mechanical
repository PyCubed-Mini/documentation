    PQ-Mat-04: contact the Launch Service Provider for any other materials not specified in PQ-Mat-02
  
  Out-gassing/ Thermal
    Must complete a thermal vacuum bakeout to boil off sublimates and derisk out-gassing issues
    PQ-Gen-04: Out-gassing requirements:
      TML<=1%
      CVCM <=0.1%
  
  Vibration
    Must complete testing for sinusoidal and random vibration (found in launch vehicle suppliers Payload User Guide)

  Dimensions/ Tolerances (1P PocketQube)
    Dimensions: 50x50x50mm cube with 58x64x1.6mm backplate (see albaorbital reference or PocketQube Standard table 1 and figure 2 in section 2.2)
      PQ-Mech-02: 51.6+/-0.1mm wide (Y dim in figure 2), 50.0mm + 1.6mm for the backplate thickness
      PQ-Mech-03: 50.0+/-0.1mm wide (X dim in figure 2), with backplate 58.0+/-0.1mm in the same direction
      PQ-Mech-04: 50.0+/-0.1mm long (Z dim in figure 2), with backplate 64.0+/-0.1mm in the same direction
      PQ-Mech-07: rail clamping dimensions shall be 2mm on either side of the backplate (see figures 4 and 5 in the PocketQube Standard)
      PQ-Mech-08: envelope for components shall be no more than 7mm; appendages and deployables, max 10mm is allowed if Launch Service Providered can adapt (must complete waiver for this)
      PQ-Mech-09: all deployable must be constrained by the PocketQube and not the deployer
      PQ-Mech-10: min. contact surface of the PocketQube shall be 21.5mm from both sides on the Z-axis (see figure 6 in the PocketQube Standard)
      PQ-Mech-11: contact surface between pusher plate or stacked PocketQubes is outlined in figure 7
    Kill switches:
      PQ-Mech-12: shall use at least two kill switches to keep the PocketQube offline in deployer
      PQ-Mech-13: kill switches shall make contact witht the deployer rail or with another PocketQube (see figure 6)
      PQ-Mech-14: kill switches shall be located only on the Z-axis; placement options (see figure 6):
        - in the lateral side of the satellite within 20mm from the Z-faces and touching the deployment rails
        - aligned with the backplate in the Z-face and in contact and in contact with the PocketQube below or the pusher plate
      PQ-Mech-15: kill switches shall not obstruct ejection of the satellite from the deployer
    Mass:
      PQ-Mass-01: >=250g
      PQ-Mass-04: center of mass shall not exceed 1 cm from its geometric center in stowed position
    Deployables: must not touch the walls of the AlbaPod
    
  Batteries
    PQ-Gen-03: Batteries will be protected from thermal runaway
