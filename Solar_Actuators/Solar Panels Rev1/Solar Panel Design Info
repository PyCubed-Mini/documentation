//-----Solar Panel Specs-----\\
All panels are 6-layer PCBs with the magnetorquer taking up the inner 4 layers.
+/-X, and +/-Z are 48.4mm x 48.4mm (STILL BEING TWEAKED BY STRUCTURES)
The "missing" 1.6mm is due to the thickness of the PCB, so we should check the thickness

+Y is 50mm x 50mm (no overlap)

-Y is ~64mm x 58mm (The "rails" slide over ~3mm on each side of the 58mm length, so ~52mm x 64mm effective area)
^Double Check! (Pulled from the PocketCube standard)


//---Components on all PCBs---\\
Front Side:
Solar Cells - https://github.com/spacecraft-design-lab-2019/documentation/wiki/Solar-Cell-Survey
^Use any combination to maximize power on a panel. Try to get the voltage output to be ~3V (2V<voltage<5V). Upper limit is from MPPT
Sun Sensors - [Fill in with link to sun sensor]
Diodes - [Fill in with link to diode]
^Surface-mount SB diode, should get from Prof or Max
Two types of Diodes: Bypass Diodes, which are in parallel with each set of parallel solar cells
                     Blocking Diodes, which are in series with the total solar cell circuit (see 'Solar Cell Overview.png')

Back Side:
Flat Flex Connector - [Fill in with link to flat flex connector]
MPPT Circuit - [Fill in with link to circuit]


//--Components on select PCBS--\\
+Y Panel:
2 Antennas (ask Tim Vrakas on Avionics for info on the width of the antenna)
SMA connectors for the antennas

-Y Panel:
Hole for camera, ~22mm in diameter in the center of the board (check with structures - they said they were tweaking)


//--------Magnetorquers--------\\
Make 5 mil (0.005 inch) traces with a 5 mil separation from the next trace
Connect both ends to the Flat Flex Connector
