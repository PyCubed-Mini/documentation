//-----Solar Panel Specs-----\\
All panels are 6-layer PCBs with the magnetorquer taking up the inner 4 layers.
+/-X, +/-Z, and +Y are ~48mm x 48mm (STILL BEING TWEAKED BY STRUCTURES)

-Y is ~64mm x 58mm (The "rails" slide over ~3mm on each side of the 58mm length, so ~52mm x 64mm effective area)
^Double Check!


//---Components on all PCBs---\\
Front Side:
Solar Cells - https://github.com/spacecraft-design-lab-2019/documentation/wiki/Solar-Cell-Survey
^Use any combination to maximize power on a panel. Try to get the voltage output to be ~3V (2V<voltage<5V). Upper limit is from MPPT
Diodes - 
^Surface-mount SB diode, should get from Prof or Max
Sen Sensors - 

Back Side:
Flat Flex Connector - 
MPPT Circuit - 


//--Components on select PCBS--\\
+Y Panel:
2 Antennas (ask Tim Vrakas on Avionics for info on the width of the antenna)
SMA connectors for the antennas

-Y Panel:
Hole for camera, ~22mm in diameter in the center of the board (check with structures - they said they were tweaking)
