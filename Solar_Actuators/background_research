mppt (maximum power point tracking) = electronic DC/DC converter from solar panels to batteries
•	Lowers voltage to something the batteries can use while minimizing power losses
•	SPV1040 used on FossaSat - https://www.st.com/en/power-management/spv1040.html
o	Input voltage range 0.3–5.5V
o	Output voltage range 2-5.2V
•	Other option: SPV1050 (not meant specifically for solar panels)
o	Input voltage range 0.075-18V
o	Output voltage range 2.6-5.3V
FossaSat:
•	https://github.com/Bambofy/FOSSASAT-1
•	Deployable solar cells (nearly triples available power)
o	Use metal hinges & torsion springs for deployment -> check with mechanical team if considering
•	Uses 3 MPPTs (1 per axis) to maximize efficiency between shaded panels
•	Solar cell deployment is risky- if we do it we need to make sure the system can still work undeployed
•	Half wave 433mHz antenna made of metal carpenter’s tape (deployable without exterior mechanisms)

EPS ~1/3 of total spacecraft mass
Batteries can’t be charged upon launch -> activate 30 min after release

•	Standardized PMAD: bus voltage of 8.2V
•	Able to distribute 5V & 3.3V supplies
•	Universal capabilities:
o	Junctions to transfer power from generation source
o	Power conditioner
o	Switching circuit to divert power to systems/instrumentation
o	Incorporate capacitor to add energy if battery voltage is insufficient

Solar cell configuration options (based on available IXYS):
•	2 22x35 mm + 2 23x8 mm
•	2 22x35 mm + 2 22x7 mm
•	2x7 grid of 22x7 mm
•	2x8 grid of 23x8 mm
